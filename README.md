# PasswordGenerator

This is a random password generator for people who don't want to think of a password on there own!  It generates a random set of alphanumeric characters and special characters.  Users can input the length of the desired password.

I had intended to include a section to copy previously generated passwords to the clipboard and display those below, however I hit a bit of a roadblock and didn't manage to finish that tonight :( I hope to update my work tomorrow to complete this part. 

Below is an image and link to my Password Generator!
